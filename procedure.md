Follow the following steps to obtain the IR spectra of CO<sub>2</sub>

1. Choose a frequency from the options present in the simulation.
2. Note down the corresponding energy from the graph.
3. Observe the molecular movement for the selected frequency.
4. Rotate the molecule to see the movement from the forward direction.

Note that the bond between atoms exists during the movement, but is not being displayed due to limitations of the simulator
