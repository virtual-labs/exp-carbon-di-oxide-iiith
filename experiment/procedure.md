Follow the following steps to obtain the IR spectra of CO<sub>2</sub>

1. Construct the molecule CO2 in gaussview and setup the calculation for optimization and frequency with desired basis set and method.
2. Once the calculation is done, open the output file > Results > vibrations.
3. Select the different frequencies and look at their modes of vibration.
