      "explanations": {
        "b": "Number of normal modes are given by 3N-5 for linear molecules and 3N-6 for non linear molecules where N is the number of atoms."

      "question": "How many vibrational normal modes are present in benzene?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "12",
        "b": "20",
        "c": "30",
        "d": "24"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Benzene has 12 atoms and is non-linear, hence 3N-6 gives 30."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Even though the energy of the vibrational energy levels are increased they are quantized and any transition among the vibrational levels will still occur in the IR region."

        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Change in dipole moment during the vibrational stretch causes the molecule to interact with the incoming radiation and hence be IR active"
